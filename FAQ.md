# FAQ

Here you can find some frequently asked questions about OST.

## How to test your OST patch with OST?

Post a `/ost` comment on your patch in GitHub.

## How to test your non-OST patch (i.e. a vdsm, ovirt-engine patch) with OST?

All non-OST patches can be tested posting the comment /ost in your GitHub patch.

## My OST patch build is failing and I don't know why. Where can I get some further information?

When an OST run fails for your patch, you should see in the PR:

```text
All checks have failed,
1 failing check'.
OST Failing after Xm
Click on 'Details'.
```

There you will find a link to the failing job with the job id.
In that link, accessing the 'console output' would gain you some more information.
