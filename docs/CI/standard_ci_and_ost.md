Using standard CI with ovirt-system-tests
=========================================

oVirt system tests uses the [Standard CI][1] infrastructure <br>
to enable automatic verification of new code via the oVirt CI server.<br>
It allows developers to verify their code immediatly after they submit it to gerrit for review.

See more info on the oVirt infra page [Standard CI][1]
